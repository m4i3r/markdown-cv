## While I'm not working

__Homelab__

A Home Lab is bascially a single or multiple computers that reside in your home, which act as servers to test, develop and share services for private use. Services I personally selfhost include a password manager, VPN, reverse proxy, cloud storage and many more.

__Sports__

Sport has become one of the biggest offsets for me in everyday life. My focus mostly lies on training in the Gym to build up strength and running for stamina and willpower.

__Volunteer in Ambulance Service__

Even though it is not my main job anymore I still love the work with people through the ambulance service. That's why I'm volunteering as an EMT in the German Ambulance Service for a handful of shifts per month.
